# Images Json Portal

Images Json Portal is a Web Api generator for images. As a hosting service you can upload your images to produce API. You can choose which attributes to add in your Json (size, resolution, length, ...).

Your custom API can be used for galleries, sliders or wherever you need images and you do not need to save them locally. 
You can decide to pick your images by using url or in binary format. The url makes the Json lighter in terms of data to send through but embedding images directly in your page can have in general a better performance.
Try! It's time to use API!

Like [flickr](https://www.flickr.com/) you can also simply hosts your images and use whenever you need.
